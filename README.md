This is a carpooling project. First, users need to register and choose between driver and passenger. Then, they can login. After login drivers are presented with a list of passengers who have selected rides where they are the driver. This list includes the option to rate passengers. Drivers can add a ride as well, by pinning markers on a map (implemented as a fragment) and inserting price, date and time of the ride (implemented as another fragment). After login, passengers are shown a list of available rides. Only future rides (those with dates in the future) are displayed. By clicking on a ride in the list, passengers can view detailed information, including the driver’s rating (here is where the fragments are implemented, as well as portrait and landscape layouts). By clicking on the Choose button, passengers can select the ride. Through the My Rides button, passengers can view all the rides they’ve chosen. In this section, passengers also have the ability to rate drivers.
